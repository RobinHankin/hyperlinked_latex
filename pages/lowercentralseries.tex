  \section{Lower central series help}

The {\bf lower central series} of a Lie algebra $L$ is the sequence of
Lie algebras formed by taking successive Lie brackets with $L$.

\mainbox{Formally, the lower central series of a Lie algebra $L$ is
  the series}{L^1=L'\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad L^k=\bracket{L}{L^{k-1}}\qquad\mbox{for $k>1$}}


\subsection*{Facts}

\begin{itemize}
\item $L\supseteq L^1\supseteq L^2\supseteq L^3\supseteq\ldots$
\item If the lower central series for $L$ bottoms out and includes the
  trivial Lie algebra \boldzero, we say that $L$ is a
  \nilpotentliealgebra.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Be careful to distinguish the lower central series from the
\derivedseries, which is defined as $L^{(1)}=L'$ and
$L^{(k)}=\bracket{L^{(k-1)}}{L^{(k-1)}}$ for $k>1$.
\end{itemize}

  \section{Semisimple help here!}

  A Lie algebra $L$ is {\bf semisimple} if it has no nontrivial
  \solvable\ \ideal s (or equivalently that the \radicalideal\ is
  trivial).

  Compare \simple.  A Lie algebra is simple if it is semisimple and
  nonabelian.

  \subsection*{Facts}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A lie algebra is semisimple iff it has no nonzero abelian
    ideals.
    \item Every semisimple Lie algebra is a \directsum\ of
      \simple\ Lie algebras.
    \item If $L$ is a lie algebra and $\radicalidealmath L$ its
      \radicalideal, then the factor algebra $L/\radicalidealmath L$ is
      semisimple.
      \item The concept of
        \hyperlink{nilpotentliealgebra_help}{nilpotence} is a bit like
        being semisimple, but nilpotence kind of sucks.
  \end{itemize}

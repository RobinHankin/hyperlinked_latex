  \section{Help on the matrix group  \protect\slncmg\
    and the Lie algebra \protect\slncla}

The {\bf special linear group} \slncmg\ is the matrix Lie group of
$n\times n$ orthogonal matrices with complex entries and determinant
$+1$; the group operation is ordinary matrix multiplication.

The corresponding \liealgebra\ (over $\mathbb{C}$) is \slncla, the Lie
algebra of $n\times n$ matrices with complex entries and \trace\ zero.
Sometimes this is written
$\operatorname{\textswab{s:l}}\left(n;\mathbb{C}\right)$ (that was
{\tt textswab} font).  The Lie bracket is defined as the commutator:
$\bracket{x}{y}=xy-yx$.

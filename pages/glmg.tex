  \section{Help on the general linear matrix group $\mathsf{GL}(n;\mathbb{C})$}

The {\bf general linear group} $\mathsf{GL}(n;\mathbb{C})$ is the
group of $n\times n$ matrices with complex entries.
$\mathsf{GL}(n;\mathbb{R})$ would be the special case with real
entries.

Sometimes we denote the set of $n\times n$ matrices with complex
entries as $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ (this is not a group as some matrices
will not have an inverse).

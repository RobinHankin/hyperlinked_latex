If $L$ is a \liealgebra, $I$ is a {\bf subalgebra} of $L$ if it is
a \subspace\ of $L$ that is closed under Lie brackets.

\mainbox{Formally, $I$ is a subalgebra of $L$ if}{x,y\in
  I\longrightarrow \bracket{x}{y}\in I}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The condition of being a subalgebra is weaker than $I$ being
    an \ideal\ of $L$.  A subalgebra only needs to be closed under the
    taking of a Lie bracket; whereas an ideal $I$ has the property
    that $\bracket{I}{x}\in I$ for any $x\in L$, not just any $x\in
    I$.
\end{itemize}

  \section{Derived series help here!}

The {\bf derived series} of Lie algebra $L$ is the sequence of
\derivedalgebra s.


\mainbox{Formally, The derived series of Lie algebra $L$ is the series with terms}{L^{(1)}=L'\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
  L^{(k)}=\bracket{L^{(k-1)}}{L^{(k-1)}}\qquad\mbox{for $k>1$}
}

\subsection*{Facts}
\begin{itemize}
\item The series is ordered by inclusion: $L\supseteq L^{(1)}\supseteq
  L^{(2)}\supseteq L^{(3)}\supseteq\ldots$.
\item The derived series is the fastest descending series whose
  successive quotients are Abelian.
  \item if the derived series of $L$ bottoms out and includes
    \boldzero, then we say that $L$ is \solvable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
Be careful to distinguish the derived series from the
\lowercentralseries, which is defined as $L^1=L'$ and
$L^k=\bracket{L}{L^{k-1}}$, for $k>1$.  
\end{itemize}

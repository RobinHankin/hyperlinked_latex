  \section{Normal subgroup help here!}

An {\bf normal subgroup} is a subgroup that is closed under
conjugation.  Formally, if $G$ is a group and $N\leq G$, then $N$
is normal if:

\begin{empheq}[box={\mymath[colback=red!10,sharp corners]}]{equation*}
x^{-1}Nx\in N
\end{empheq}


Alternatively, we might write $xN=Nx$.  The equivalent concept in Lie
algebra is the \ideal.

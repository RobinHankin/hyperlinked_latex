  \section{Derived algebra help here!}


  The {\bf derived algebra} $L'$ of Lie algebra $L$ is the span of Lie
  brackets of elements of $L$.

  \mainbox{Formally,}{
    L'=\bracket{L}{L}=\operatorname{Span}(\bracket{x}{y}\colon x,y\in L)
  }

  \subsection*{Facts}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The derived algebra is an \ideal\ of $L$; it is also
    sometimes called the {\bf commutator algebra}.
  \item The derived algebra of the derived algebra is denoted $L^{(2)}$, and
    so on; see \derivedseries.
  \item The derived algebra of \sltwoc is \sltwoc, and this is the
    only nontrivial Lie algebra with this property; in other words, if
    $L=L'$ then $L=\sltwoc$.
    \item

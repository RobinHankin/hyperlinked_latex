  The {\bf trace} of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements.   It
  maps a Lie algebra to its ground field.  It is a \liealgebrahomo:

  \begin{flalign*}
    \tracemath\left(\bracket{x}{y}\right) &= \tracemath\left(xy-yx\right)\\
    &=\tracemath xy-\tracemath yx\\
    &=0
  \end{flalign*}
  
  But $\bracket{\tracemath x}{\tracemath y}=0$ as well, for the Lie
  bracket is evaluated in the ground field of the matrices.

  Because of associativity and the commutation property, we have

  \[
  \tracemath\left(X^{-1}YX\right)=\tracemath\left(Y\right)
  \]

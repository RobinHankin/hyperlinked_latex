  \section{Derivation help here}

A {\bf derivation} is a linear map that, like differentiation, obeys
Leibniz's law.
  
\mainbox{Formally, if $A$ is an (associative) algebra over a field
  $F$, then a {\bf derivation} of $A$ is a linear map $D\colon
  A\mapsto A$ such that}{D(ab) = aD(b) + D(a)b\quad\mbox{for all
    $a,b\in A$}}



\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item An {\bf inner derivation} is a derivation of the form
    $x\mapsto\bracket{x}{y}$ for some $y$.  If a derivation is not an
    inner derivation, it is known as an {\bf outer derivation}
\end{itemize}
